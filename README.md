## WHY YOU CREATED THIS?

There were a couple of reasons:

- Most of the things I do from fish shell and I don't want to open my browser and go to
  some page. I can do it quicker, from my shell.
- I control app, I know what is going on with uploaded files.
- I do not have to pay for premium/spend 20$ to use it twice in month. For my purposes it takes only
  3$
- And I just wanted to see how golang works

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### ACCESS KEYS

For security reasons I did not wanted to create `Access Keys`. I was unsure if only one person will
use this app, thus I skipped this step in infrastructure. You need to generate those keys on
your own. You
can [do it by following this AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)

## LICENCE

You can fork it(you should, this solution could need some tweaks to fit your needs,
like number of users or **deployment region**), you can copy it, you can brake it.
I do not take responsibility for this solution.
